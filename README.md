# SleepHypnogram_Testing
Testing the data recorded by the Sleep Hypnogram device

There are in total 38 text files with sleep hypnogram recordings, 


Each text file includes a row of data under "reference data" as well as a row of data under "test data".

Context:

-          All data is a measurement of sleep, known as a hypnogram. A hypnogram can only take 4 valid discrete values - 1, 5, 6, 7 â€“ which represent the different stages of sleep.

-          Reference data is the gold standard for sleep measurement (polysomnography). Assume this to be a perfectly accurate measurement.

-          Test data is the reading which comes from an RST sleep tracking system under evaluation. This needs to be compared to the gold standard reference.
